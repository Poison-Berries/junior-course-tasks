# junior-course-tasks
Contains (some) CTF tasks prepared for the [Silaeder](https://vk.com/silaedr) CTF Club's classes

## For users

- Consider each directory as a separate repository with its own license. There is no common license for all the tasks
- Note that many, most, or all of the tasks are in Russian

## For contributors

If you want to add a task to this repository, you are supposed to create a Pull Request with your task added. Remember that:

- It's recommended that you create one PR per task or a group of tasks related to the same topic

- You should place all your tasks' files in a directory at a path of the following format: `/CATEGORY/YEAR-TOPIC[-OTHERINFO]`,
  for example, `/web/2021-cookies` or `/crypto/2019-base16,32,64,85-exam`

- Each of your directories inside category directories should have a `README.md` file with at least the following info:
  - Name and a brief description
  - Libraries needed for your task(s) to run, if any
  - Command to run your task(s)
  - Link to the author(s) (GitHub/Telegram/E-mail/other social networks)

- You can also add metafiles like `LICENSE` file inside your directory, workflow files (`.github/workflows/`), and so on

No matter if you're adding a task or making a contribution of another kind, remember to **give your commits proper names**!
